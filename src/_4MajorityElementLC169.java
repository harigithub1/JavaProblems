/**
 * ✅ This code uses the Boyer-Moore Majority Vote Algorithm
 * That is the official, correct name of the pattern/technique you're using.
 *
 * If someone asks:
 * "What pattern is this?"
 *
 * You should say:
 * "This is the Boyer-Moore Majority Vote algorithm."
 * That's the answer interviewers expect.
 *
 * If they go one level deeper:
 *
 * 1️⃣ Algorithm Name
 * 👉 Boyer-Moore Majority Vote
 *
 * 2️⃣ Algorithm Type
 * 👉 Greedy Algorithm
 *
 * Because it makes local decisions without backtracking.
 *
 * So you can also say:
 * "It's a greedy voting algorithm using Boyer-Moore."
